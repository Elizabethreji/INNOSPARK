### Project Description
EcoSwap is a sustainable product marketplace for buying, selling, swapping, or donating eco-friendly and second-hand items. It focuses on sustainability with features like an Eco-Footprint Tracker, gamified rewards (EcoPoints), AI-powered product matching, and a community-driven ecosystem. The platform includes an EcoHub for sustainable ecology enthusiasts to connect and an AI bot for providing sustainable education.

### The Problem statement
The growing need for a platform where individuals can easily and securely exchange items or services in an environmentally conscious way. Many people struggle to find a reliable and sustainable way to swap goods, and EcoSwap addresses this by providing a simple, user-friendly system for connecting like-minded individuals. It also ensures data security and efficient management of user information, promoting a circular economy and reducing waste.

5.AI-Based Product Matching: AI algorithms suggest eco-friendly products based on user preferences, past purchases, and sustainability goals.

6.Community Engagement Features (Forums, Eco-Hubs): Users can interact, share tips, and collaborate on eco-projects through discussion forums and community hubs.

7.Trust and Transparency (Rating System, Verified Profiles): A rating system for users to leave feedback and verified profiles to ensure trust and safety in transactions.

8.Educational Content (Blogs, Tutorials, Videos): A resource center offering blogs, tutorials, and videos to educate users on sustainable living and eco-friendly products.
