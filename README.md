### Project Description
EcoSwap is a sustainable product marketplace for buying, selling, swapping, or donating eco-friendly and second-hand items. It focuses on sustainability with features like an Eco-Footprint Tracker, gamified rewards (EcoPoints), AI-powered product matching, and a community-driven ecosystem. The platform includes an EcoHub for sustainable ecology enthusiasts to connect and an AI bot for providing sustainable education.

### The Problem statement
The growing need for a platform where individuals can easily and securely exchange items or services in an environmentally conscious way. Many people struggle to find a reliable and sustainable way to swap goods, and EcoSwap addresses this by providing a simple, user-friendly system for connecting like-minded individuals. It also ensures data security and efficient management of user information, promoting a circular economy and reducing waste.

### The Solution

### Solutions

1. **User Registration & Profile Setup**  
   Users can easily create accounts and set up personalized profiles to track their sustainability goals. This feature enables them to tailor their experience on the platform to align with their eco-friendly values.

2. **Marketplace Features (Buy, Sell, Swap)**  
   The platform offers a marketplace where users can buy eco-friendly products, sell items they no longer need, or swap goods  from the website by utilising ecopoints to reduce waste and promote sustainable consumption.

3. **Eco-Footprint Tracker**  
   Our Eco-Footprint Tracker allows users to monitor and visualize their environmental impact based on their purchases, swaps, and other platform activities. It helps users stay mindful of their sustainability efforts.

4. **Gamification (EcoPoints Rewards)**  
   Users earn EcoPoints for taking eco-friendly actions such as buying sustainable products or recycling. These points can be redeemed for rewards like discounts, eco-friendly products, or even donations to environmental causes.

5. **AI-Based Product Matching**  
   Leveraging AI, this feature recommends eco-friendly products based on user preferences, previous activities, and their sustainability goals, enhancing the shopping experience and supporting more mindful purchases.

6. **Community Engagement Features (Forums, Eco-Hubs)**  
   The platform includes discussion forums and Eco-Hubs where users can engage with like-minded individuals, share sustainability tips, collaborate on green initiatives, and create a vibrant community focused on environmental change.

7. **Trust and Transparency (Rating System, Verified Profiles)**  
   To foster a safe and reliable marketplace, the platform includes a rating system that allows users to leave feedback on transactions. Verified profiles help ensure trust and transparency in buying and selling.

8. **Educational Content (Blogs, Tutorials, Videos)**  
   A comprehensive resource hub with blogs, tutorials, and videos helps users learn about sustainable living practices, the benefits of eco-friendly products, and how to reduce their environmental footprint.

9. **Feedback System with EcoPoints Deduction for Sellers**  
   Our feedback system holds sellers accountable by deducting EcoPoints for negative reviews, ensuring that sellers maintain high-quality service and trustworthiness within the community.
